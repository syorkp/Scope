folly, the great folly: I appeared on the market-place.
And when I spake unto all, I spake unto none. In the evening, however,
rope-dancers were my companions, and corpses; and I myself almost a
corpse.
With the new morning, however, there came unto me a new truth: then
did I learn to say: “Of what account to me are market-place and populace
and populace-noise and long populace-ears!”
Ye higher men, learn THIS from me: On the market-place no one
believeth in higher men. But if ye will speak there, very well! The
populace, however, blinketh: “We are all equal.”
“Ye higher men,”—so blinketh the populace—“there are no higher men,
we are all equal; man is man, before God—we are all equal!”
Before God!—Now, however, this God hath died. Before the populace,
however, we will not be equal. Ye higher men, away from the market-place!""",
                        """Before God!—Now however this God hath died! Ye higher men, this
God was your greatest danger.
Only since he lay in the grave have ye again arisen. Now only cometh the
great noontide, now only doth the higher man become—master!
Have ye understood this word, O my brethren? Ye are frightened: do your
hearts turn giddy? Doth the abyss here yawn for you? Doth the hell-hound
here yelp at you?
Well! Take heart! ye higher men! Now only travaileth the mountain of
the human future. God hath died: now do WE desire—the Superman to live.""",
                        """The most careful ask to-day: “How is man to be maintained?”
Zarathustra however asketh, as the first and only one: “How is man to beSURPASSED?”
The Superman, I have at heart; THAT is the first and only thing to me—
and NOT man: not the neighbour, not the poorest, not the sorriest, not the
best.—
O my brethren, what I can love in man is that he is an over-going and a
down-going. And also in you there is much that maketh me love and hope.
In that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me hope. For the
great despisers are the great reverers.
In that ye have despaired, there is much to honour. For ye have not
learned to submit yourselves, ye have not learned petty policy.
For to-day have the petty people become master: they all preach
submission and humility and policy and diligence and consideration and the
long et cetera of petty virtues.
Whatever is of the effeminate type, whatever originateth from the servile
type, and especially the populace-mishmash:—THAT wisheth now to be
master of all human destiny—O disgust! Disgust! Disgust!
THAT asketh and asketh and never tireth: “How is man to maintain
himself best, longest, most pleasantly?” Thereby—are they the masters of
to-day.
These masters of to-day—surpass them, O my brethren—these petty
people: THEY are the Superman’s greatest danger!
Surpass, ye higher men, the petty virtues, the petty policy, the sand-grain
considerateness, the ant-hill trumpery, the pitiable comfortableness, the
“happiness of the greatest number”—!
And rather despair than submit yourselves. And verily, I love you,
because ye know not to-day how to live, ye higher men! For thus do YE
live—best!""",
                        """Have ye courage, O my brethren? Are ye stout-hearted? NOT the
courage before witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, which not even
a God any longer beholdeth?
Cold souls, mules, the blind and the drunken, I do not call stout-hearted.
He hath heart who knoweth fear, but VANQUISHETH it; who seeth the
abyss, but with PRIDE.He who seeth the abyss, but with eagle’s eyes,—he who with eagle’s
talons GRASPETH the abyss: he hath courage.—""",

only it be still true to-day! For the evil is man’s best force.
“Man must become better and eviler”—so do I teach. The evilest is
necessary for the Superman’s best.
It may have been well for the preacher of the petty people to suffer and
be burdened by men’s sin. I, however, rejoice in great sin as my great
CONSOLATION.—
Such things, however, are not said for long ears. Every word, also, is not
suited for every mouth. These are fine far-away things: at them sheep’s
claws shall not grasp!""",

wrong?

Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier
footpaths?
Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! Always more, always better ones of your
type shall succumb,—for ye shall always have it worse and harder. Thus
only—
—Thus only groweth man aloft to the height where the lightning striketh
and shattereth him: high enough for the lightning!
Towards the few, the long, the remote go forth my soul and my seeking:
of what account to me are your many little, short miseries!
Ye do not yet suffer enough for me! For ye suffer from yourselves, ye
have not yet suffered FROM MAN. Ye would lie if ye spake otherwise!
None of you suffereth from what I have suffered.—"""]}
d2 = {"The Vision and the Enigma": ["""'The Vision and the Enigma' is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his
most obscure vein. We must know how persistently he inveighed against the
oppressing and depressing influence of man’s sense of guilt and
consciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this
discourse. Slowly but surely, he thought the values of Christianity and
Judaic traditions had done their work in the minds of men. What were once
but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of humanity,
had now passed into man’s blood and had become instincts. This oppressive
and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what Nietzsche refers to when he
speaks of “the spirit of gravity.” This creature half-dwarf, half-mole, whom
he bears with him a certain distance on his climb and finally defies, and
whom he calls his devil and arch-enemy, is nothing more than the heavy
millstone “guilty conscience,” together with the concept of sin which at
present hangs round the neck of men. To rise above it—to soar—is the most
difficult of all things to-day. Nietzsche is able to think cheerfully and
optimistically of the possibility of life in this world recurring again and
again, when he has once cast the dwarf from his shoulders, and he
announces his doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence of all things great and
small to his arch-enemy and in defiance of him.
That there is much to be said for Nietzsche’s hypothesis of the Eternal
Recurrence of all things great and small, nobody who has read the literature
on the subject will doubt for an instant; but it remains a very daring
conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate effect, as a dogma, on
the minds of men, I venture to doubt whether Nietzsche ever properly
estimated its worth (see Note on Chapter LVII.).
What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra sees a young shepherd
struggling on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his throat.
The sage, assuming that the snake must have crawled into the young man’s
mouth while he lay sleeping, runs to his help and pulls at the loathsome
reptile with all his might, but in vain. At last, in despair, Zarathustra appeals
to the young man’s will. Knowing full well what a ghastly operation he is
recommending, he nevertheless cries, “Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!” as theonly possible solution of the difficulty. The young shepherd bites, and far
away he spits the snake’s head, whereupon he rises, “No longer shepherd,
no longer man—a transfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that
LAUGHED! Never on earth laughed a man as he laughed!”
In this parable the young shepherd is obviously the man of to-day; the
snake that chokes him represents the stultifying and paralysing social values
that threaten to shatter humanity, and the advice “Bite! Bite!” is but
Nietzsche’s exasperated cry to mankind to alter their values before it is too
late."""]}
